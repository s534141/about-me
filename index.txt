Matthew - 1

I am a Junior in Computer Science and I plan to graduate in Fall of 2020.

I am from Kansas City, attended Liberty High School, and transferred to Northwest from Missouri S&T 2 semesters ago. I don't have any experience with internships/jobs relating to computer science but I've just always liked computers and took all the classes they offered for it in High School.

I don't really have any preferences for what kind of job I get as long as I can use my CS degree. Any form of Software Engineer, Network Admin, or Web Dev would all be perfectly fine with me.

Something interesting about me is that I am wholly uninteresting (from my perspective).  My Github. (Links to an external site.)
